### Hello and Welcome to my Profile ðŸ‘‹

Hello,

My name is Carlos Emmanuel Alvarez, but I like to go by Mannie. I am a Full Stack Web Developer who is always looking for the next best thing to work on and create. I love to be part of projects that can make a difference in the world and being a developer is the best way I can.
